# DeepseekMCP Implementation Changes

This document outlines the key changes made to implement file handling and fix various issues in the DeepseekMCP server.

## Fixed File Handling

1. **Implemented `readFile` Function**: 
   - Added a proper implementation of the `readFile` function that was previously a placeholder
   - Now properly reads files from the file system using `os.ReadFile`

2. **Enhanced File Content Formatting**:
   - Improved how file contents are included in queries
   - Added proper markdown formatting with syntax highlighting based on file type
   - Organized files under a "Reference Files" section with clear headings

3. **Added Language Detection**:
   - Implemented `getLanguageFromPath` function to detect programming language for syntax highlighting
   - Supports over 30 common programming languages and file formats
   - Improves readability of code snippets in the AI responses

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced error messages with more context about file operations
   - Added file count and size information in error messages
   - Centralized error response creation for consistency

## API Compatibility Changes

1. **DeepSeek Client Initialization**:
   - Fixed the client initialization to match the actual DeepSeek Go client API
   - The client no longer returns an error from NewClient

2. **Simplified File Management**:
   - Removed the FileStore that was trying to use non-existent Files API
   - Focused on embedding file contents directly in the messages
   - Created a simpler file validation approach

3. **Cache Implementation**:
   - Redesigned the cache system to work without the File API
   - Implemented in-memory cache storage with proper thread safety
   - Changed to store file paths instead of file IDs

4. **Fixed JSON Handling**:
   - Updated protocol.RawMessage references to use encoding/json.RawMessage
   - Fixed compatibility issues with the MCP protocol

## Code Structure Improvements

1. **Simplified Request Handling**:
   - Consolidated duplicate code paths for file and non-file requests
   - Reduced code complexity by centralizing the API request flow

2. **Better Interface Definitions**:
   - Updated middleware code to use interface types instead of concrete types
   - Made the code more flexible and less dependent on the MCP implementation

3. **Cleaner Import Organization**:
   - Removed unused imports across the codebase
   - Improved code organization and readability

## Usage Improvements

The server now provides better handling of files in queries:

- Multiple files can be included with proper syntax highlighting
- Files are clearly labeled and organized
- File content is formatted in a way that respects the structure of the code

For example, when including a Go file, the content will be formatted like:

```go
// Your Go code here
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Instead of plain text, which improves readability and helps the DeepSeek model better understand the code.

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

1. Implementing automatic clean-up of expired caches
2. Adding persistent storage for caches
3. Enhancing file type detection beyond file extensions
4. Adding unit tests for the core functionality
