# DeepseekMCP Project Update

## Recent Updates

The DeepseekMCP project has been significantly improved with the following changes:

1. **Fixed File Handling**: Implemented proper file reading and integration with DeepSeek API.
2. **Improved Caching System**: Redesigned the cache system to work with file paths instead of relying on a Files API.
3. **API Compatibility**: Fixed compatibility issues with the DeepSeek Go client library.
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added better error messages and context to help troubleshoot issues.
5. **Better Code Structure**: Simplified request handling and improved code organization.

## Breaking Changes

Some breaking changes were made to accommodate the differences between our expectations and the actual DeepSeek API implementation:

1. **File API Not Available**: The DeepSeek Go client library does not have a dedicated Files API as originally expected. Instead, we've implemented file handling by embedding file contents directly in the messages.

2. **Cache Implementation**: The cache now stores file paths directly instead of file IDs. If you were using the cache with file IDs, you will need to update your code.

## How to Use Files

Files are now handled by directly embedding their contents in the messages. You can use the `file_paths` parameter to specify the paths to files you want to include:

```json
{
  "name": "deepseek_ask",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "Can you explain this code?",
    "file_paths": ["/path/to/your/file.go", "/path/to/another/file.py"]
  }
}
```

The files will be displayed in the query with proper markdown formatting and syntax highlighting based on their file extensions.

## Caching

Caching is now simpler and works directly with file paths:

```json
{
  "name": "deepseek_ask",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "Can you explain this code?",
    "file_paths": ["/path/to/your/file.go"],
    "use_cache": true,
    "cache_ttl": "1h"
  }
}
```

The cache is currently in-memory only, which means it will be lost when the server restarts. Future updates may include persistent storage for caches.

## Next Steps

The following improvements are planned for future updates:

1. **Automatic Cache Cleanup**: Implementing a background goroutine to clean up expired caches.
2. **Persistent Cache Storage**: Adding an option to store caches on disk for persistence across restarts.
3. **Enhanced File Type Detection**: Improving file type detection beyond file extensions.
4. **Unit Tests**: Adding comprehensive unit tests for the core functionality.
