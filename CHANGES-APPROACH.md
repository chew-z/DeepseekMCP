# DeepseekMCP Implementation Changes - Modified Approach

After analyzing the current implementation and the DeepSeek Go client library structure, we need to simplify our approach to file handling. This document outlines the key changes we'll make to adapt to the limitations of the current DeepSeek Go client library.

## Main Issue

The DeepSeek Go client library does not currently expose a Files API as we initially expected. The current implementation in `files.go` tries to use methods like `client.Files.Upload()`, `client.Files.Get()`, etc., but these don't exist in the actual library.

## Solution Approach

1. **Simplify File Handling**:
   - Remove the dedicated FileStore that tries to use a non-existent Files API
   - Focus on embedding file contents directly into the messages sent to the DeepSeek API
   - This matches what we've already implemented in the `handleAskDeepseek` function

2. **CacheStore Changes**:
   - Simplify the CacheStore to not depend on the FileStore
   - Store file paths instead of file IDs in the cache
   - When using a cache, read the files again if needed
   
3. **Implementation Changes**:
   - The `readFile` function in `deepseek.go` already works correctly
   - We need to fix the Client initialization to match the actual DeepSeek Go client
   - We need to remove the references to the non-existent Files API
   - We need to update the protocol.RawMessage references to use encoding/json.RawMessage instead

## Tasks

1. Fix Client initialization
2. Simplify FileStore and CacheStore
3. Update the message handling to focus on embedding files directly in messages
4. Fix protocol.RawMessage references

By focusing on a simpler approach that doesn't rely on a dedicated Files API, we can get the DeepseekMCP server working properly while still providing excellent file handling capabilities.
